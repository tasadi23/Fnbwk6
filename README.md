📇 Week 6 – Contact Book App & Working with APIs Welcome to Week 6 of the FNB App Academy and the final week of the Intermediate Phase!

The last two weeks have been a serious level-up. I’ve been juggling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve managed to build real functionality into my apps. That alone is something to be proud of — it's not easy to switch between three different languages and keep your head straight. But I did it.

🔥 This Week’s Challenge: The Contact Book App Now it’s time to push things even further.

This week’s project is my most advanced one yet: building a fully functional Contact Book app. But here’s the twist, instead of manually adding contact info into the code, this app will connect to an API to pull real data from an external database.

That means I'm stepping into the world of dynamic data and remote communication, which is a huge milestone.

🌐 What’s an API, and Why Does It Matter? An API (Application Programming Interface) is basically a bridge that lets my app talk to other services. It’s how modern apps:

Get live weather info Pull user profiles Show social media feeds Search databases,like I’ll be doing with contacts By learning how to work with APIs, I’m unlocking one of the most powerful tools in modern web development.

🎯 My Focus for the Week Understand how to make requests and handle responses in JavaScript Learn about fetching data, JSON formatting, and rendering that data into HTML Combine all three core skills — structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript) to make something that feels real and dynamic ✅ Final Thoughts This week marks the end of the Intermediate Phase and what a journey it’s been. I’ve gone from building static pages to creating interactive, data-driven apps. The Contact Book app is more than just another project. It’s a statement: I can build something that talks to the internet.

And that’s a big deal.

Let’s finish strong. 💪📱
